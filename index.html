			<p>While watching the movie Waking Life I came across a
			scene that inspired me to write this thesis. In the scene you
			see a group of young guys wandering around a city. They
			have a long talk about very complicated and substantial
			matter. It’s hard to follow what they are actually talking
			about and it gives the viewer the feeling they are highly intellectial
			and very well informed about complicated matter.
			All of an sudden an old man attracts their attention. The
			man is sitting in a 3-meter high pole. The guys look up and
			ask the man how he ended up there and why he ended up
			there. The man answers he is not exactly sure how he ended
			up on this pole. There is a moment of silence after which
			the guys ask the man if they could help him getting down
			again. The man looks confused but answers that he’s actually
			doing fine high up in the pole. The guys don’t understand
			the man’s choice but decide to continue walking.</p>
			<p>This scene brought up the following questions:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>How do I normally relate action and theory within my
				design process?</li>
				<li>Is there something like a perfect balance between thinking
				and doing when it comes to designing?</li>
				<li>Could you categorize people in a spectrum from thinking
				to doing?</li>
				<li>When do you start a project from a theoretical starting
				point and when do you decide to start a project with a
				concrete action?</li>
				<li>If you start a project with an action are you always looking
				for a reaction?</li>
				<li>What is action? Aren’t some written theories as much action
				as ‘concrete’ action? Theories also aim for reactions
				right?</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="question" style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:30px;">
				<p style="margin-top:30px; margin-bottom:15px">Research question:</p>
				<h2>How to generate action with your creative skills?</h2>
			</div>

			<p>When talking about the relationship between thinking and
			doing, I would like to examine the process within our own
			bodies. The following question can be asked:</p>

			<h2>What makes a thought transform into an action?</h2>

			<p>When I want to move my fingers tot type something, I don’t
experience the physical chain of actions needed to make my
fingers move.
Something that’s not concrete (a thought) is translated in to
a concrete action (movement of the body). What happens
between those two events? Deepak Chopra, educated as a
doctor and later specialized in alternative medicine, talks
7
about this mysterious gap between a thought and an
action in his book Quantum Healing, Exploring the Frontiers
of Mind / Body Medicine. Chopra talks about the importance
of the discovery of neuropeptides. Neuropeptides
are small protein-like molecules (peptides) used by neurons
to communicate with each other. They are neuronal signaling
molecules that influence the activity of the brain and the
body in specific ways.x. Chopra visualizes the mystery between
a thought and an action in the following diagram.</p>
