							<p style="margin-bottom:0">Nowadays, graphic design education places great emphasis on the conceptual and theoretical aspects of design. But no matter what, it almost never comes to a real design (strategy) positioned in our reality. <br>I have the desire to implement my designs in the real world and see if my ideas actually work. Therefore I researched the way graphic design is applied in practice. </p>

							<h2>How can I generate a positive effect in the real world with my design skills? </h2>

							<p>To get a better insight I did literature research and interviewed experts. I analysed different (graphic design) projects and compared these case studies.
							<br>
							To have an impact, we should put our design ideas out there, in the real world, and see what happens.</p>

						<p>While watching the movie Waking Life I came across a scene that inspired me to write this thesis. In this specific scene you see a group of young guys wandering around a city. They have a long talk about very complicated and substantial matter. It is hard to follow what they are actually talking about and it gives the viewer the feeling they are highly intellectual and very well informed about complicated matter. All of a sudden an old man attracts their attention. The man is sitting in a 3-meter high pole. The guys look up and ask the man how and why he ended up there. The man answers he is not exactly sure how he ended up on this pole. There is a moment of silence after which the guys ask the man if they could help him getting down again. The man looks confused but answers that he’s actually doing fine high up in the pole. The guys don’t understand the man’s choice but decide to continue walking. The following monologue follows:

						<h3>“No worse than us. He is all action, no theory. We are al theory and no action.”

						<p>
						When talking about the relationship between thinking and doing, I would like to examine the process within our own bodies. The following question can be asked:
						</p>

						<h3>What makes a thought transform into an action?</h3>

						<p>As I’m typing this text I don’t experience the physical chain of actions needed to make my fingers move. It feels automated. 
						Something that’s not concrete (the thoughts about the text I want to write down) is translated in to a concrete action (movement of my fingers on the keyboard). What happens between those two events?</p>

						<p>Deepak Chopra (1947), a doctor and expert in the field of mind-body healing, talks about this mysterious gap between a thought and an action in his book Quantum Healing. Chopra talks about the discovery of neuropeptides. Neuropeptides are small protein-like molecules used by neurons to communicate with each other.  Chopra visualizes the mystery between a thought and an action in the following diagram:</p>

						<img src="theory/chopra.png" alt="">
						<p>
						point A represents a thought, all the other letters represent physical actions that follow from point A. Point A is for example the sentence I construct in my mind after which neurons are activated to make my fingers move in a specific way across the keyboard to translate my thought to letters appearing on my computer screen. As Chopra explains: 
						</p>

						<div class="quote">
							“All the physical changes that take place in the body can be connected in a logical chain of cause and effect, except for the space after A. This is the point where the transformation from thought to matter first occurs and it must occur, or the rest of the events will not happen.”
						</div>

						<p>Chopra does not give the answer to the question what makes a thought translate into an action but he emphasizes the importance of the transformation of the immaterial thought to the material action. 
						</p>

						<p>Where Chopra focuses on the mysterious connection between mind and body philosopher Réne Descartes (1596-1650) states that mind and body are separable. The mind can exist outside of the body, and the body is an entity that cannot think. Descartes is famous for his quote “Cogito ergo sum” which means “I think, therefore I am”. This statement is known as Cartesian dualism. Descartes sees the mind as consciousness and the physical brain the source of intelligence.
						</p>

						<div class="quote">
						“Although I have a body that is joined very closely to me, since I have on the one hand a clear and distinct idea of myself insofar as I am a thinking, non-extended thing and, on the other hand, I have a distinct idea of the body insofar as it is merely and extended, non-thinking thing, it is certain that I (that is, the mind) am really distinct from my body and that I can exist without it.”

							<h3>Case #1</h3>
							<h4>Stichting Buurtbeheer en –ontwikkeling Zeeheldenkwartier</h4>
								<p>
							Stichting Buurtbeheer en –ontwikkeling Zeeheldenkwartier is an organisation based in The Hague. Also known as BBOZ, they help people that have difficulties participating in our society to get a job. Next to that they provide guidance to these people and try to help them get back in society. They work closely together with local authorities of The Hague and provide the city with employees that contribute to the maintenance of the public space.
							</p>
							<p>
							They asked me as a graphic designer to come up with a new corporate identity consisting of a new logo and a website proposal. What I had to offer to BBOZ were my design skils and solution driven concepts.
							The question that came immediately in mind after BBOZ briefed me about the assignment was the following: <i>What do the people working for BBOZ have to offer?</i>
							</p>
							<p>
							The answer to this question was clear; their personal story and experience. To harvest those stories, it was necessary to get to know the team and employees at BBOZ. Therefore, I decided to visit the location and started a conversation with the people behind the organisation.
							</p>
							<p>
							These talks made me realise that BBOZ needed something different next to their initial quest for a new brand identity. Where they assumed they needed a professional corporate identity to improve their visibility as an organisation, I realised their strength could be found in an aspect within their organisation. A strength they were not aware of themselves. Next to creating jobs for people, they provided those people personal guidance and a safe place that created stability for them. The organisation does not have a lot of money, but a lot of care and love to give. The power of the organisation lays within the people working for BBOZ. By communicating the personal stories to a broader audience, people will get a better idea of the essence and necessity of an organisation like BBOZ. 
							</p>
							<p>
							I decided to interview the director of the organisation and let him explain the (hi)story of BBOZ. In this way I avoided telling a story about the organisation but I gave the organisation the chance to tell the story themselves. I designed a publication existing of the interview, photos of the workplace and the new identity I created together with my peer students. In the end we provided BBOZ with a new identity but this was only one part of a bigger story that in my opinion had to be told. By giving a stage to the story of BBOZ, I showed the main strenght of the organisation and went beyond the act of forcing a shallow logo upon the organisation. 
							</p>

							<p>
							Where a lot of designers are able to make propper design for existing content, action and a participatory approach leads to the possibility to create content yourself as a designer. With the use of your creative skills, this content can be visualised and get accessible for a broader audience. By combining content creation and your creative skills you can distinguish yourself from other designers which can be very valuable in the competitive environment of design.
							</p>

							<h3>Case #2</h3>
							<h4>SIRE v.s. SIRE-EUS?!</h4>

							<p>
							A good example is a project I recently did together with Renée Janssen (producer) and Vera van der Seyp (graphic designer). 
							SIRE is a Dutch independent organisation that uses campaigns to create awareness about social topics within our society.  In 2017 SIRE launched the campaign ‘Laat jij jouw jongen genoeg jongen zijn?’ The goal of this campaign was to encouraged parents to let their sons behave more manly. Together with a lot of other people, I strongly disagreed with the way they tried to make a problem visible. 
							SIRE formulated the initial problem as followed:
							</p>
							<div class="quote">
							“Boys and girls are equal, but not the same. We, Dutch educators, sometimes lose sight of the fact that boys develop in a different way and learn differently than girls. In general, educators expect children to behave calmly, listen carefully and sit still. While boys learn more by discovering, experimenting, taking risks, doing. Educators seem to appreciate less ‘boys’ behavior in recent years. Restraining boys inhibits their development.”
