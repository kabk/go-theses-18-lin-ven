						a stage to investigate how the artistic approach is influenced by the urge to prioritise.

						The size of the exhibition space is 32 x 42 x 25 cm 
						which is based on the maximum size of free cabin luggage allowed on a Wizz Air flight.

						A process of choosing, selecting, deleting and refining

						<img src="process/KONTAIN-logo.png" alt="">
						<p>“Kontain is a collective of non-profit
exhibition spaces founded in April 2018.
The aim is to explore the relation between
the container and its content.
How to reveal unexpected potential of
standardized spaces?”<br><br>
I will create a series of physicial spaces
(around 5). The shape of these spaces
will be based on daily life objects. I’ll invite
a selection of artists, photographers
and designers to create a work for
a specific given space. They will be asked
to work with the theme of the unexpected
potential of this standardized space. <br><br>
I will promote the exhibition spaces
as a collective called KONTAIN.
This promotion will include online
promotion, a website, posters, and
an exhibition catalogue.</p><br><br>


						<p style="color:blue"><b>TEXT</b> DOG & PONY SHOW 6 MARCH 2018</p>
						<p><b>1. ORGANISATION</b><br>
						I am fascinated by the way we organize our world.
						We create all kinds of frameworks.
						<p><i>A perfect example is this Dog & Pony show. 35 graduates are asked to pitch their proposal within 200 seconds. We have the beamer [ ] and this microphone
						to convey our message to an audience. All sitting in an organized auditorium.
						It’s a very restricted framework to create an efficient way of handling 35 individual presentation within a specific timeframe of one day.</i><br>
						The Dog & Pony framework has as goal to be efficient. Other reasons to organize our world are for example:
							<ul>
								<li>gain control</li>
								<li>protect ourselves from uncomfortable situations</li>
								<li>save time and money</li>
								<li>create safety</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

						<p>Organizing things is a way of fixating an always moving world. Those ways of organizing ourselves comes with certain expectation patterns.</p>

						<p><b>2. EXPECTATIONS</b><br>
							Expectations are strong beliefs that something will happen or be the case. They come in all form and sizes.
						<i>It can be our everyday expectation of the sun to rise, but it can also be the expectation of our pizza to be ready in 12 minutes.</i><br>The more we fixate ourselves within structures and systems, the more we fixate on the expected results of certain actions.</p>

						<p><b>3. PROBLEM</b><br>
						even though we try very hard to organise ourselves in understandable systems - life is inconsistent. Now and then, some more than others, we are confronted with unexpected situations. Also these situations come in all shapes and sizes. For instance, your app says the bus arrives at twelve - it doesn’t. How do we handle these UNexpectations? Do we get irritated or do we directly anticipate and find an other bus to bring us were we want to be?<br>Over-organizing won’t eliminate all unexpected situations and can lead to unlearning to coop with these situations. In other words, we unlearn to anticipate. and this is problematic.
						</p>

						<p><b>4. RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b><br>
						 Therefore my questions are: </p>
						 <p style="color:blue"> <b>How does behavioral conditioning influence our ability to anticipate in unexpected situations?</b></p>
						 <p style="color:blue"> <b>How can I as a designer confront people with their routines and create space for the fun of unexpectations?</b>
						</p>

						<p><b>5. POSITION</b><br>
						I think an increase of awareness of our fixations and assumptions is important.
						We have the tendency to fixate ourselves in made frameworks to decrease the amount of uncomfortable situations. But there is a certain beauty in these uncomfortable situations. It gives space to play and surprise yourself, instead of getting irritated or angry. <br>
						By seeing the reality of inconsistency you don’t loose yourself in anxiety or hope.
						</p>

						<p><b>6. GOAL</b><br>
						As designers we have the responsibility to take in account the user experience of our designs. I want to shake up the relation between form and expectations. By creating minimal interventions in everyday systems, I want to confront my audience in a humorous way with their own automatic pilot.
						</p>

						<p>I want to do this in order to <br>
							1. create awareness of the limitations given by certain expectation patterns <br>
							2. stress the importance of the ability to anticipate</p>

							<p><b>I want to create an ode to the unexpected.</b></p><br><br>



						<p style="color:blue">NOTES 15 FEB 2018</p>
						<p><b>CONTAINER & CONTENT</b><br>How do these two relate? What happens when content wants to fit in a container while it's too big? The dimensions of the container define the dimensions of the content. Everything is placed within a container. Not only physically, also conceptually. We live in a huge matryoshka: The body is our container (presuming 'me' is not just my body), our body is sitting in a room, which is part of a house, a building, a street, a  city, a province, a country, etc. Being in a container is unavoidable. But when and why does the content become aware of the container? Simple, When you start bumping your head against the ceiling or you only juuuust fit in. When something easily fit in the given container, it doesn't have to be aware of it's existing. But when you only just fit or just not fit, you get confronted with it. And what happens when the container doesn't supply the space needed for the content? </p>
							<ul>
								<li>1. The content is anyways squeezed into the container.</li>
								<li>2. Parts of the content are left outside the container.</li>
								<li>3. The content is adjusted to fit in the container. ( think of ikea furniture ) </li>
								<li>4. Hacking the container: the container is adjusted in a way the content anyways fit in it's original size. </li>
							</ul>

							<p>when does this matryoshka system starts working against you? </p>
